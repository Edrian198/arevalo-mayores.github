				<h1>Welcome to Marinduque, the hidden gem of the Philippines!</h1>
				<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
			    <p>Marinduque, the heart of the Philippines, is a first class province and one of the tourism hubs in the country, a God-centered, empowered, healthy citizenry, proud of their heritage and identity as globally competitive Marinduqueños, living peacefully in a safe environment and habitation, a self sustaining tourism-oriented community with vibrant local economy under a responsive, transparent and accountable government.</p>

			    
				<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
			    <p>To develop competent, accountable and proactive civil servants committed to support and involve the community pursuing sustainable development that harnesses the natural, human, and fiscal resources and ensuring a well-coordinated delivery of efficient and effective basic social services sensitive of people’s culture and heritage.</p>

				<h2 id="history">History</h2>
			    <p>During the Spanish colonization in the late 1500s, Marinduque was part of the Batangas Province. Later on, it became part of the province of Mindoro. Marinduque only became a province of its own during the American colonization. Its first government was established in Boac, now known as the province’s capital town.</p>

			    <p>The provincial island of Marinduque is found in between Oriental Mindoro and Quezon Province at the Southern Part of Luzon. It is part of the Region IV-B provinces, along with (Occidental and Oriental) Mindoro, Romblon, and Palawan. Similar to the majority of the Philippines, the people of Marinduque use Tagalog as its main language, with hints of dialects from the nearby Bicol and Visayan provinces as well as from the locals themselves.

Marinduque is called "The Heart of the Philippines," as the shape of the provincial island is similar to that of a human heart. Its location in the arrangement of the archipelago is also similar to the anatomy of where the heart is in the human body.</p>
